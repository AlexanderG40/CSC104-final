            <p>What started this whole project was back in high school. I was having a hard time figuring out my schedule between football practice and homework after a long day of class.</p>
            <p>My first way to combat this was by creating a bunch of notes on my phone that would tell me my schedule. However, the issue with this is that it took up quite a lot of space after a while and was not as convenient.
                 While this website that I made still has some tweaks I could make to make it better, it does its work by allowing the user to journal after a long day of work or studying.  </p>
